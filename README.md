# CIIFEN-Pluviogram Digitizer project
## Project Description

**Pluviogram Digitizer** is an innovative tool designed to effortlessly transform scanned images of rainfall strips on paper into complete digital datasets. This project focuses on automating the analysis of precipitation data, making data collection, analysis, and processing more efficient in real-time. With a smooth user interface built using **Angular** and a robust **SQL**-based backend, Pluviogram Digitizer combines efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility to improve climate data management.

### Key Features:
- **Precise Digitization**: Uses a **Python**-programmed digitization algorithm to convert rainfall data into high-resolution time series.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The web platform provides an intuitive interface where users can access digitized data and visualize results graphically.
- **User Sessions**: Users can create sessions to manage their data in a personalized way, ensuring organized and efficient usage.
- **Data Visualization**: The digitized data is displayed on the platform with graphical visualization for easy and direct analysis.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of **Pluviogram Digitizer** is to automate the process of digitizing precipitation data from scanned images of paper rainfall strips, providing users with an efficient and accessible platform for visualizing and analyzing such data.

### Contribution of Group "White Hats":
This project was developed by the **“White Hats”** group, students of **Software Engineering II** at the **Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (FIEC)**. Through various meetings with **CIIFEN**, the technical and functional details of the platform were defined.

## Approval Act

Through this act, **CIIFEN** approves the work and participation of the **“White Hats”** group in the various meetings held, where important points regarding the design and functionality of the web platform and the code for scanning pluviograms were discussed. The following agreements were reached:

1. **Time Series**: Hourly and instantaneous temporal resolution (every ten minutes) generated by the digitization algorithm developed in **Python**.
2. **Web Page**: Development of a web page with user authentication and detailed visualization of the digitized data.
3. **Server Deployment**: The system will be deployed on a server provided by **CIIFEN** to ensure its operation and accessibility.
